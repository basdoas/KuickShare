# Source it. Gives the test scripts a throwaway home in RAM (/dev/shm), so a test run never touches the real settings, history, trusted devices or received files:
#   env "${SANDBOX_ENV[@]}" <command>   run a command in the sandbox
#   sandbox_cleanup                     delete it (call it when the test ends)
# Sourcing it also deletes the sandboxes of earlier runs that were not cleaned up (the script was killed): those whose owner, recorded in `pid`, is no longer running.
# Only the daemon and the shell run in it: adb, nmcli and the other tools keep the real home.
# XDG_RUNTIME_DIR and the session bus stay real, so tray, notifications and job tracker work.
